# AlterStoreClient
  Alter(native)Store client for KaiOS.

## What is this?

AlterStore repositories do not work on their own, they need a client to access the apps. This is exactly it - the first and probably most barebones AlterStore client.

This Git repository is actually a AlterStore repository itself, so AlterStore can automatically update itself (with your consent, of course).

All code here is written with barebones HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No compilation needed, all ready to go.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release (recommended), or any version that suits your application from the [releases page of this repo](https://github.com/jkelol111/AlterStoreClient/releases).

2. Unzip the release somewhere.

3. Setup the KaiOS Simulator, or use old Firefox WebIDE, Pale Moon WebIDE (removed, but available in older versions), [kdeploy](https://github.com/kaiostech/kdeploy), or `make-kaios-install` (available in my GitHub) to install (I assume you know how to use these tools).

## Updating

If AlterStore has a new update, it will prompt you during an app repositories refresh or when you explicitly use the 'AlterStore Update' in 'Options'. The client will close while it updates, so wait for a few minutes before opening the client again.

## Thanks

BananaHackers community & everyone involved there, KaiOS Technologies for reviving B2G, and Firefox their B2G project and for the idea that everyone should be install their own apps, and not be bound by a closed ecosystem.
